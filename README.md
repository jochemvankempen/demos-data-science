This repository contains a step-by-step guide to a selection of analyses techniques listed below.

## Techniques

### AUROC (signal-detection)
Compute area under receiver operating characteristic curve:
[signal-detection-AUROC](./signal-detection-AUROC.ipynb).

### Logistic regression
Compute logistic regression, general linear model.
[GLM-logistic-regression](./GLM-logistic-regression.ipynb)

### Maximum likelihood estimation
Compute maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) in model fitting.
[MLE](./maximum-likelihood-estimation.ipynb)

### PCA (dimensionality-reduction)
Perform principal component analysis (PCA) on neural activity, over time-averaged and time-resolved data: 
[dimensionality-reduction-PCA](./dimensionality-reduction-PCA.ipynb).

### Recurrent neural network (RNN) in pytorch
Predict behavioural output (time series) based on neural activity in primary motor cortex. 
[RNN](./motor_output_prediction.ipynb)
